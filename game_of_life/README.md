Conway's Game of Life / Summer'15 CodeRetreat
--------------------------------------------

> The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead.

> * Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
> * Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
> * Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
> * Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
